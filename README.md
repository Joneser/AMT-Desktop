AMT-Desktop
===========

This is a continuation of my final degree dissertation. 

It transcribes music contained in a .wav file into sheet music in order to allow musicians to learn the audio without having to try and learn the music by ear.

I originally implemented this using Matlab, and converted the algorithm to Java to allow it to be run without needing Matlab installed and providing a simple GUI for the user.

The 3rd-party libraries used are abc4j(output of abc notation to sheet music) and JTransforms(use of DFT algorithm).
