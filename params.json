{"name":"Amt-desktop","tagline":"Automatic Music Transcription","body":"AMT-Desktop\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis is a continuation of my final degree dissertation. \r\n\r\nIt transcribes music contained in a .wav file into sheet music in order to allow musicians to learn the audio without having to try and learn the music by ear.\r\n\r\nI originally implemented this using Matlab, and converted the algorithm to Java to allow it to be run without needing Matlab installed and providing a simple GUI for the user.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd-party libraries used are abc4j(output of abc notation to sheet music) and JTransforms(use of DFT algorithm).\r\n","google":"UA-48162923-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
